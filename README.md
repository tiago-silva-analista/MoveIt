## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed at the NLW - Next Level Week trainning based on the technologies:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Verce](https://vercel.com)

## :anchor: Structure

We are using **ReactJS** to create a frontend application monitor and suggest some exercises during a break in the work day

This kind of exercises are divided in two types: body and eyes.

The exercises are suggesting after 25 minutes and the user can accept or ignore the exercise if the job can't be interrupted. 

After the exercises execution, the user will acumulate some XP's and grow up the level.
